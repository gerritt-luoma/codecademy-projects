# Codecademy projects
I will be using this public monorepo to store any projects made while completing [Codecademy](codecademy.com) courses.

In progress project:
- Ravenous.  A React app used to search for restaurants through the use of the Yelp API.  This is a multi part project as a part of the "Create a Front-End App with React Skill Path" course.
  - [x] Part One: Beginning the project.  Use create-react-app to create a new project and start creating basic components without any props or state
  - [x] Part Two: Use props to pass information from parent components to child components
  - [x] Part Three: Begin to implement stateful logic to the search bar component preparing to use the Yelp API to display results
  - [ ] Part Four: Query Yelp API using the components to display results on the home page 

Future Project:
- Build a React App for custom playlists that combines multiple components, interactive search functionality, and requests to the Spotify API.
