## Project: Codecademy Create a Front-End App with React Capstone

### About
This project is the capstone for the `Codecademy Create a Front-End App with React Capstone` using React and the Spotify API to create a playlist creation app.  You are able to search for tracks, enter a name for the playlist, add tracks from the search to the playlist, and save it to your account.

### What I learned
- Making requests to servers using `async`/`await`
- Combining stateless React components with stateful React components to change and display data on the screen
- I should really start using Typescript for projects like this.  Having intellisense for all of my props would have been very nice
